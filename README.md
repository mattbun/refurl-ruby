That (that's probably not the final name for it)
======

You know how url shorteners and image hosting websites have cool URLs like this one? http://i.imgur.com/nuR4V.gif

What if you could make cool links like that that point to your own files? If a friend wants something off of your computer, you could just send them a simple link like "yourdomain.com/nuR4V" and they could download it directly from your computer at home!

Well, that's what this program is. Still a work-in-progress. Not ready for public consumption and _definitely_ not ready to be exposed to the internet.
